# Mondrian-Image
This repository demonstrates how to create a Mondrian-style artwork using HTML and CSS Grid. Inspired by the iconic abstract art of Piet Mondrian, the project showcases two distinct methods to construct the artwork:
index.html: Uses the CSS Grid layout to create the Mondrian design.
main.html: Implements another alternative method to build the same design.
Features:
The source image (included in the repository) specifies the exact grid size and layout used for the design.
Fully responsive and lightweight implementation.
Aesthetic recreation of Mondrian art with clean, maintainable HTML and CSS code.
How to Use:
Open index.html to view the grid-based approach.
Open main.html to explore an alternative method.
Compare the two approaches and choose the one that suits your needs or inspires your creativity!
Feel free to fork, contribute, or use this repository as a learning resource for CSS Grid and creative web design.
